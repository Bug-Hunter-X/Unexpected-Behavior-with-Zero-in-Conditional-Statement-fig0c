# Julia Function Bug: Zero Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Julia code: the lack of explicit handling of zero values in conditional statements. The `bug.jl` file contains a function with a flawed zero handling mechanism, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version.

The original function incorrectly assumes that handling positive and negative numbers is sufficient, causing it to not work as expected for the input of zero.  The solution showcases proper zero handling and illustrates best practices to ensure the function behaves consistently across the entire number spectrum. This is a critical point to consider while handling conditional logic in Julia.
